This repository contains the **knowledge base** and **policies** used by the CAP demo
for a fictional bank in collaboration with Alto.

Folders:

- `kb/` – Technical and operational knowledge (service overviews, playbooks, runbooks).

- `standards/` – Summaries/mappings for NIST CSF, ISO 27001, HIPAA, EU AI Act, etc.
- `use_cases/` – Narrative descriptions of the demo scenarios (mobile banking outage, disinformation, etc.).
