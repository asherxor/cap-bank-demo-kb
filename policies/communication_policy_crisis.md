# Crisis Communication Policy – Bank Demo

## 1. Purpose

Define how the bank communicates **during major incidents or disinformation events** to:

- Protect customers.
- Maintain trust.
- Meet regulatory expectations.

This policy assumes the bank has a **verifiable evidence backbone** via CAP.

---

## 2. Scope

- Applies to:
  - Security incidents.
  - Operational outages (e.g., mobile app downtime).
  - Disinformation campaigns targeting the bank.
- Applies to:
  - Executive team.
  - Communications/PR.
  - Customer support.
  - Any staff authorized to speak externally.

---

## 3. Principles

1. **Evidence-first**  
   - All external statements **must be grounded** in verified evidence from CAP.
2. **Consistency**  
   - Internal and external messaging must align; no conflicting narratives.
3. **Timeliness**  
   - Provide early updates even if investigation is ongoing, with clear caveats.
4. **Clarity**  
   - Avoid jargon; use plain language customers understand.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Communications Lead**
  - Owns message drafting and approval workflow.
  - Coordinates with Incident Manager and CISO.
- **Incident Manager**
  - Confirms factual status using CAP:
    - Evidence.
    - Attestations.
    - Anchors.
- **Legal & Compliance**
  - Reviews messages for regulatory risk.

## 5. Use of CAP in Crisis Comms

Before issuing a statement:

1. Confirm with Incident Manager:
   - What CAP shows for relevant services:
     - Latest SBOMs.
     - Attestations and their verification status.
     - Canon anchors (or SCITT/DBoM in future).
2. If an Org Agent has been run for the incident:
   - Review its Evidence/Attestation produced via promotion.
   - Use its structured findings as input to messaging.

Statements should be traceable to **specific CAP records** when dealing with regulators.

## 6. Template Messages (Examples)

### 6.1 Outage Without Data Compromise

> “We are currently experiencing an outage in our mobile banking app.  
> Our internal attestation platform confirms that no unauthorized changes were deployed and there is no evidence of data compromise.  
> Your funds and balances remain safe. We are working to restore service as quickly as possible.”

### 6.2 Under Investigation

> “We are aware of reports circulating on social media about [issue].  
> We are actively investigating using our attestation and evidence platform.  
> We will provide an update by [time] or sooner as soon as we have verified information to share.”

---

## 7. Post-Incident Review

After each major incident or disinformation wave:

- Update relevant KnowledgeArtifacts:
  - Playbooks.
  - Use cases.
- Capture a **Post-Incident Org Agent run** and promote it to Evidence/Attestation in CAP.
- Adjust this policy if gaps are identified.
