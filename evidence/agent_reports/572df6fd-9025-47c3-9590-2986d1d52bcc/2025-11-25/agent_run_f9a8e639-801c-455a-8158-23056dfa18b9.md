**Status**: done

## Input
```
Analyze the following SBOM for compliance with NIST CSF and ISO 27001:

The SBOM contains:
- banking-core v3.2.1 (proprietary software)
- openssl v3.0.8 (Apache-2.0 license)

Please provide:
1. License compliance assessment
2. Security posture evaluation
3. Recommendations for improvement
4. NIST CSF mapping
5. ISO 27001 control coverage
```

## Output
```
1. **License Compliance Assessment**:
   - **banking-core v3.2.1**: As proprietary software, its licensing terms must be reviewed internally to ensure compliance. Ensure that usage aligns with the vendor’s licensing agreements.
   - **openssl v3.0.8 (Apache-2.0 license)**: Apache-2.0 is a permissive license that allows for use, modification, and distribution, provided that the license terms are met (e.g., including proper attribution and license text).

2. **Security Posture Evaluation**:
   - Assess the proprietary banking-core for any known vulnerabilities and patch management processes. Ensure regular updates and vulnerability assessments are in place.
   - OpenSSL is widely used but can be vulnerable if not updated regularly. Ensure that OpenSSL's version adheres to security best practices and is up-to-date with security patches.

3. **Recommendations for Improvement**:
   - Implement a routine review process for proprietary software compliance, including regular updates and patch management.
   - Perform regular vulnerability assessments on both proprietary and open-source components.
   - Document and maintain compliance records for software licenses and security measures.
   - Establish a formal security awareness program for team members handling these software components.

4. **NIST CSF Mapping**:
   - **Identify**: Asset management for proprietary software and open-source components.
   - **Protect**: Implement access controls, data protection measures for proprietary software; ensure OpenSSL is properly configured.
   - **Detect**: Regular audits and vulnerability scanning for detection of any anomalies or security risks.
   - **Respond**: Develop an incident response plan that includes both proprietary software and OpenSSL vulnerabilities.
   - **Recover**: Establish backup and recovery processes for proprietary software to ensure business continuity.

5. **ISO 27001 Control Coverage**:
   - **A.8 Asset Management**: Identification and classification of software components.
   - **A.9 Access Control**: Manage access to both proprietary and open-source software.
   - **A.12 Operations Security**: Security in the operation of software and patch management.
   - **A.14 System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance**: Ensure secure development practices for proprietary software.
   - **A.16 Information Security Incident Management**: Incident management processes for software-related incidents.

This analysis should serve as a foundation for compliance and security measure enhancements. Regular reviews and updates are crucial as threats evolve.
